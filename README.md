# AI-Powered Scam Message Detector

An intelligent Python-based tool that identifies scam messages using a custom rule-based and machine learning model. Designed to analyze message patterns, assign scores to multiple scam indicators, and classify input as **SCAM** or **REAL** ‚Äî all while explaining **why**.

## Features

- Classifies input messages as **SCAM** or **REAL**
- Uses a custom-built feature extractor for:
  - Money requests
  - Urgency
  - Grammar issues
  - Suspicious links
  - Upfront payments
  - Celebrity references
  - Reward offers
  - Pressure tactics
  - Unusual contact methods
  - Official appearance fakes
  - Unsecured sources
  - Threats or blackmail
- Machine Learning classifier (Random Forest)
- Accuracy report with precision, recall, and F1-score

## Dataset Structure

Your dataset file `labeled_dataset.csv` should look like this:

```
message,label,urgency,money_request,official_appearance,reward_offer,celebrity_reference,grammar_issues,unusual_contact_method,pressure_to_act,suspicious_link,upfront_payment
"Message text",scam,0.9,1.0,0.7,0.6,0.0,0.4,0.2,0.9,0.0,0.5
```

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If there's no `requirements.txt`, install dependencies manually:

```
pip install scikit-learn pandas

## Sample Usage (CLI)

```
Enter a message to check (or 'quit' to exit):
Congratulations! You've won $5,000! Claim now or lose it forever.

Prediction: SCAM

Enter a message to check (or 'quit' to exit):
```

## Sample Usage (GUI)
```
python3 endpoints.py
```

You will see a website with the same scam detector

## How It Works

Each message is processed by a feature extraction system that searches for 100+ scammy keywords across 12 different psychological and linguistic factors. These values are then used by a Random Forest model to classify the message.
