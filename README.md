  - Threats or blackmail
- 📊 Machine Learning classifier (Random Forest)
- 📈 Accuracy report with precision, recall, and F1-score

## 📁 Dataset Structure

Your dataset file `labeled_dataset.csv` should look like this:

```csv
message,label,urgency,money_request,official_appearance,reward_offer,celebrity_reference,grammar_issues,unusual_contact_method,pressure_to_act,suspicious_link,upfront_payment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows

🤖 Prediction: SCAM
📌 Reason:
- High urgency (0.95)
- Money request (1.0)
- Reward offer (1.0)
- Pressure to act (0.9)
```

## 🧠 How It Works

Each message is processed by a feature extraction system that searches for 100+ scammy keywords across 12 different psychological and linguistic factors. These values are then used by a Random Forest model to classify the message.
